                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <h5>Software Engineering Student</h5>
                    <p>My name is Lucija from Tetovo, Macedonia. I'm a left-handed libra that just finished her first year of college. I study Software Engineering but I'm also really creative and have a talent for design, so I'm hoping that I'll become a Front-End Developer or a Graphic Designer!
                        <br> <br> For the past 9 months a have also been a part of a non-profit student organization where I have grown on a personal level. I have been an organizer for a soft skills event where I was the PR Coordinator, designing all the posts for social media, designing flyers, posters, sertificates and more. The end products we're amaizing but the process designing and making everything made me feel happy. I knew I was meant for something creative...
                        <br> <br>
                        Before going to college, I finished Music High School where i played the Flute and Piano. For those 4 years of High School, I have played on so many stages having concerts, and I have gotten First Place awards from Solfeggio, Harmony and Flute competitions. You could say that I was Magical.
